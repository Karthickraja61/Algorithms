Tower of Hanoi
  
Rules: 

The mission is to move all the disks to some another tower without violating the sequence of arrangement. 
A few rules to be followed for Tower of Hanoi are 

	- Only one disk can be moved among the towers at any given time.
	- Only the "top" disk can be removed.
	- No large disk can sit over a small disk.
 
Algorithm:
   
To write an algorithm for Tower of Hanoi, first we need to learn how to solve this problem with lesser amount of disks, 
say → 1 or 2. We mark three towers with name, source, destination and aux (only to help moving the disks). 
If we have only one disk, then it can easily be moved from source to destination peg.

If we have 2 disks 

	- First, we move the smaller (top) disk to aux peg.
	- Then, we move the larger (bottom) disk to destination peg.
	- And finally, we move the smaller disk from aux to destination peg.

Step 1 − Move n-1 disks from source to aux
Step 2 − Move nth disk from source to dest
Step 3 − Move n-1 disks from aux to dest
