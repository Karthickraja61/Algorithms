LinearSearch:

	Linear search is the simplest searching algorithm that searches for an element in a list in sequential order.
We start at one end and check every element until the desired element is not found.

The following steps are followed to search for an element k = 1 in the list below.

		2 4 0 1 9
	Array to be searched for

1. Start from the first element, compare k with each element x.

		k≠2
		2 	4	 0	 1	 9

			k≠4
		2 	4	 0	 1	 9

				k≠0
		2 	4	 0	 1	 9

		

2. if x==k return True.

			k=1
		2 	4	 0	 1	 9


3. Else, return not found.


Time Complexity: O(n)


Linear Search Applications
1.For searching operations in smaller arrays (<100 items).
